          Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're
          looking for environment setup instructions, they've moved to their own
          section. Continue reading for an introduction to the documentation,
          Native Components, React, and more!

          React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS
          applications using React and the app platform‚Äôs native capabilities.
          With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs APIs
          as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using
          React components: bundles of reusable, nestable code. You can learn
          more about React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how
          components work in React Native.

          <h3 id="react" class="title_info">React Fundamentals</h3>

          React Native runs on React, a popular open source library for building
          user interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it
          helps to understand React itself. This section can get you started or
          can serve as a refresher course. We‚Äôre going to cover the core
          concepts behind React: + components. The rest of this introduction to
          React uses cats in its examples: friendly, approachable creatures that
          need names and a cafe to work in. + JSX. React and React Native use
          JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScript like so:
          Hello, I am your cat!. The React docs have a comprehensive guide to
          JSX you can refer to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you
          can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a name for the
          cat, name, and embedding it with curly braces inside + props. Props is
          short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù. + state. While you can think of props as
          arguments you use to configure how components render, state is like a
          component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data
          that changes over time or that comes from user interaction. State
          gives your components memory!

          <h3 id="Handling" class="title_info">Handling Text Input</h3>

          TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It
          has an onChangeText prop that takes a function to be called every time
          the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to
          be called when the text is submitted. For example, let's say that as
          the user types, you're translating their words into a different
          language. In this new language, every single word is written the same
          way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be translated as
          "üçïüçïüçï".
